# AI Image Generator Webapp

Using OpenAI's Dall-E 2.0, you can create images from a prompt, share them to the image wall and explore other generated images. You do not have to sign up, simply type a name and a prompt.

## Roadmap

- Use a real account instead of just a name

- Tokens - 1 image generation = 1 token. Some free images at the start, once you run out you can pay for more tokens through Stripe.

- Like images - Go to your account and view your liked images

- UI improvements - New logo, a hero section with a highlighted image, prompt idea help page
